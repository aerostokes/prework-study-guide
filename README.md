# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a boot camp student, I built a website to hold notes about the topics covered during by the prework: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. 
The website is built using the prework topics, and serves as both a learning experience via its creation as well as a study guide to keep track of notes taken throughout the prework.
